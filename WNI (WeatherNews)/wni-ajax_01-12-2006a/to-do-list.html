<!--- To-Do List: --->

<!--- Tabbed Debug Windows (one for each Gateway Instance being viewed) --->

<!--- Stack the Activity Monitor displays - create using Gateway Object and display selectively --->

<!--- Make sure the status bar activity does not show-up when in release mode. --->

<!--- Architect method for passing Objects from server to client using standard Object constructor/destructor 
via global var to temporaily hold the Object until it is no longer needed at which time the Object is simply
discarded Q: Is this anything like JSON ? 

JSON does not provide for "behaviors" to be passed from server to client and therefore does nothing to enhance
encapsulation for AJAX Apps.

_cache_AJAX_BehaviorObject = []; // each object has a unique ID (GUID - assigned by CF) - the cache holds ID to Object mapping
_stack_AJAX_BehaviorObject = []; // stack holds all the ID's for the purposes of clean-up

// object destructor provides easy means for cleaning-up the interface whenever the browser triggers onUnLoad event.

Each AJAX_BehaviorObject might require many Query Objs from the server.

Architect AJAX_BehaviorObject to be separate from Query Objects
